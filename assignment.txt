1. 
a) Constant: O(1)
b) Linear: O(n)

2. Constant: O(1)

3. Polynomial: O(n^k)

4. Linear: O(n)

5. Linear: O(n)

6. Polynomial: O(n^k)

7. The function pushes the sum of the last two numbers in the array into the array.  This function is of linear complexity.

8. Logarithmic: O(log(n))

9. Constant: O(1)

10.  The function tests whether a number is prime, and returns true if it's prime. It's linear, but only needs to test a maximum of half the size of the input.
